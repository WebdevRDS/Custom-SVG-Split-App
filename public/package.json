  "description": "SVGsplit is a tool for splitting an SVG file into more / smaller files. It takes the svg groups in a file (```<g> tags```) and makes each group into its own file. Tools like Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape save each layer as a separate group, so if you are making icons and have an Illustrator file with a different icon on each layer, you can save the file as a .svg file and use this tool to make each layer into its own .svg file.",
